How to Compile:
In HW2/src, enter the following command:
$ make
An executable file "hw2" will be generated in "HW2/bin"
An executable file "hw2_parallel" will be generated in "HW2/bin"

If you want to remove all executable files, please enter the following command:
$make clean

Execute:
$ <executable file> <Input file> <output file>
E.g., ../bin/hw2 ../testcase/public1.txt ../output/public1.out
