### Homework 2 score: 94

# HW3
### Given a fixed outline, a set of rectangular hard modules each with a fixed position, a set of rectangular soft modules each with a minimum area, and a set of 2-pin nets along with their weights, you are asked to implement an existing algorithm or develop your own algorithm to determine the shape and position of each soft module. All modules must be placed within the outline without overlapping, with the objective of minimizing the total weighted wirelength between modules.
### Homework 3 score: 90

# HW4
### This programming assignment asks you to write a global placer that can assign modules to desired positions on a chip.
### Homework 4 score: 87
